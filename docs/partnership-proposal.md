# AgentOS Partnership Proposal

## Executive Summary

AgentOS is a cross-platform AI operating environment designed to complement and extend Block's open-source ecosystem, particularly the Goose project. While Goose excels at development automation through CLI interfaces, AgentOS brings AI agent capabilities to end-users through a secure, privacy-first desktop application.

## Alignment with Block's Vision

### Shared Values

- **Open Source First:** MIT licensed, community-driven development
- **Developer Empowerment:** Building tools that enhance productivity and creativity
- **Privacy & Security:** Local-first architecture with user control
- **Extensibility:** Plugin architecture and MCP compatibility

### Technical Synergy

- **MCP Integration:** Native support for Model Context Protocol servers
- **Goose Compatibility:** Can execute Goose workflows within GUI environment
- **Multi-LLM Support:** Vendor-neutral approach supporting various models
- **Cross-Platform:** Rust + React for consistent experience across operating systems

## Market Opportunity

### Current Gap

While Goose serves developers excellently, there's an opportunity to bring similar AI automation capabilities to:

- **Power Users:** Non-developers who want AI automation for daily tasks
- **Enterprises:** Organizations needing GUI-based AI tools with security controls
- **Research:** Academic institutions exploring AI-native computing paradigms

### Competitive Landscape

- **Perplexity Comet:** Closed-source, browser-only, vendor lock-in
- **Google Gemini:** Chrome-only, data collection concerns
- **AgentOS:** Open-source, cross-platform, privacy-first, extensible

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Desktop Application (2025)

```

### Security Model

- **Sandboxed Execution:** AI actions run in isolated environments
- **Permission System:** Granular controls for file, network, and system access
- **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of AI actions for transparency
- **Local-First:** Default operation without cloud dependencies

## Partnership Benefits

### For Block/Goose Ecosystem

- **Market Expansion:** Extends Goose's reach beyond developer community
- **Use Case Validation:** Real-world testing of MCP and AI automation patterns
- **Community Growth:** Brings new contributors to Block's open-source ecosystem
- **Research Platform:** Foundation for exploring AI-native computing concepts

### For AgentOS

- **Technical Foundation:** Leverage proven patterns from Goose development
- **Community Access:** Tap into Block's developer ecosystem
- **Credibility:** Association with established open-source project
- **Resources:** Potential funding, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities

## Grant Request

### Funding Goals

- **Development:** 6-month sprint to Phase 1 MVP
- **Security Audit:** Professional review of permission and sandboxing systems
- **Community Building:** Documentation, tutorials, developer outreach
- **Research:** Investigation of Phase 2/3 AI-native OS concepts

### Budget Breakdown

- **Core Development:** $50,000 (2 developers, 6 months)
- **Security Audit:** $15,000 (professional security review)
- **Community & Documentation:** $10,000 (technical writing, community management)
- **Research & Prototyping:** $25,000 (Phase 2/3 exploration)
- **Total:** $100,000

### Success Metrics
