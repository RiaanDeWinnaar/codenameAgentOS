# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Electron app NODE_ENV development production mode localhost:3000 ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED webpack build issue fix

**Response:**

The **ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED** error when launching your Electron app in development mode (with `NODE_ENV=development` and `mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:3000')`) typically means that the Electron main process cannot connect to the React development server running on port 3000. This is almost always a local environment issue, not a code bug, and is closely tied to your Webpack and dev server setup.

---

## Key Causes and Immediate Fixes

- **React Dev Server Not Running:**  
  The most common cause is that the React/Webpack dev server (usually started with `npm start` or `yarn start` in the renderer directory) is not running, or is running on a different port than expected[2][3].
  
  **Action:**  
  - Make sure you have started the React dev server before launching Electron.  
  - Confirm it is running on port 3000 (the port specified in your Electron `main.ts`)[2][3].
  - Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to verify it loads.

- **Port Mismatch:**  
  If your dev server is running on a different port (e.g., 8080), update either your Electron code or your dev server config so both use the same port[3].

- **Webpack Build Issues:**  
  If your renderer build fails or is misconfigured, the dev server may not start correctly.  
  - Check your `webpack.renderer.config.js` for correct `entry`, `output`, and `devServer` settings.
  - Ensure `devServer.port` matches the port in `main.ts`.

- **Firewall/Antivirus/Proxy Issues:**  
  Local firewall, antivirus, or proxy settings can block connections to localhost[1].  
  - Temporarily disable these to test if they are interfering.

## Electron + Webpack + React Integration Checklist

To ensure smooth development mode operation, follow these steps:

1. **Start the React Dev Server First**
   - Run `npm start` or `yarn start` in your renderer directory.
   - Confirm `http://localhost:3000` is accessible in your browser.

2. **Launch Electron After Dev Server Is Ready**
   - Use a script or tool (like `concurrently` or `wait-on`) to ensure Electron only starts after the dev server is running.

3. **Verify Port Consistency**
   - In `main.ts`:
     ```typescript
     this.mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:3000');
     ```
   - In `webpack.renderer.config.js`:
     ```js
     devServer: {
       port: 3000,
       // other settings...
     }
     ```
   - Both must match.

4. **Check Webpack Build Output**
   - Ensure there are no build errors in the renderer process.
   - If using Electron Forge or electron-builder with Webpack, confirm plugin configuration is correct[4][5].

5. **Troubleshoot with Browser**
   - If `http://localhost:3000` does not load in your browser, the issue is with the dev server, not Electron.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**  
  If using HMR, ensure your Webpack config and Electron integration are compatible. Electron Forge's Webpack plugin can simplify this[4].

- **Multiple Browser Windows:**  
  If you plan to support multiple windows, ensure each window loads the correct URL and your Webpack config supports multiple HTML outputs[5].

- **Native Modules:**  
  If you use native Node modules in the renderer, ensure your Webpack config includes the necessary loaders (`node-loader`, `@vercel/webpack-asset-relocator-loader`)[4].

## Actionable Steps for Your Project

Given your project structure and the security-focused Electron setup in `main.ts`, hereâ€™s how to resolve and prevent this issue:

- **Automate Dev Server Startup:**  
  Use a tool like `wait-on` in your `package.json` scripts to ensure Electron only launches after the dev server is ready:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run start-renderer\" \"wait-on http://localhost:3000 && npm run start-electron\"",
    "start-renderer": "cd src/renderer && npm start",
    "start-electron": "electron ."
  }
  ```

- **Validate Webpack Configs:**  
  Double-check `webpack.renderer.config.js` for correct port and entry/output settings.

- **Monitor Console Output:**  
  Watch both the Electron and React dev server consoles for errors or warnings.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  Your Electron config is robust; just ensure that in development, you do not inadvertently expose sensitive APIs or allow insecure content.

## Summary Table: Common ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED Causes & Fixes

| Cause                          | Fix/Check                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Dev server not running         | Start React/Webpack dev server                  |
| Port mismatch                  | Align Electron and dev server ports             |
| Build errors                   | Fix Webpack/React build issues                  |
| Firewall/Antivirus/Proxy       | Disable/test with these off                     |
| Incorrect URL in Electron      | Use correct `loadURL` in `main.ts`              |
| Native module misconfiguration | Add required Webpack loaders                    |

---

**In summary:**  
Start your React dev server before Electron, ensure port consistency, and check for build errors. Automate startup if possible, and validate your Webpack configs for both development and production. This will resolve the ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED issue and streamline your development workflow[1][2][3][4][5].
