Since this terminal integration will be part of a larger Electron application that may include browser automation features, ensure the terminal component architecture is compatible with the new WebContentsView API. The terminal should be designed as a reusable View component that can be easily integrated alongside other WebContentsView instances for browser panels. Consider implementing the terminal as a BaseWindow subclass or View component to align with Electron's new architectural patterns. This ensures future compatibility and enables better integration with multi-tab browser automation workflows where terminal context may need to be shared or synchronized with browser sessions.\n</info added on 2025-09-08T16:59:04.751Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-08T19:31:00.859Z>\nThe research session confirms that xterm.js and node-pty remain the optimal stack for Electron terminal integration in 2024-2025. Key architectural considerations include implementing session multiplexing using a flat session registry with metadata for tabs and panes, studying Tabby's open-source codebase for advanced features like session persistence and plugin architecture, and considering Warp's block-based UI model for future collaborative terminal features. For multi-session support, implement session state serialization (command history, environment, working directory) with restoration capabilities on app restart. The terminal component should expose comprehensive theming APIs using xterm.js's theming system and CSS variables for dynamic theme switching. Security integration with the YOLO Mode Permission System should enforce granular controls on command execution and data sharing for collaborative features. Consider prototyping WebSocket-based sync layers for terminal session collaboration and implementing context-aware command suggestions using shell history analysis. The terminal architecture should support future integration with Task 22's real-time collaboration features and Task 9's context-aware intelligence system.\n</info added on 2025-09-08T19:31:00.859Z>",

The current browser panel implementation must migrate to WebContentsView which provides direct Chromium integration through the Views API and is the recommended approach for multi-tab support and browser automation. WebContentsView offers better resource management, more modular UI composition, and aligns with Chromium's native rendering pipeline. This change affects the embedded browser panel design in the layout system and requires updating the CSS Grid/Flexbox implementation to accommodate WebContentsView instances instead of BrowserView. The webContents API remains the same for DOM access and automation, but the container architecture needs to use BaseWindow as the foundation with WebContentsView components for browser tabs. This migration is essential for future compatibility and enables better automation overlay implementation and session management integration.\n</info added on 2025-09-08T17:01:23.549Z>",
