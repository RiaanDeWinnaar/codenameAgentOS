# AgentOS

AgentOS is an open-source, AI-native operating system for agents. It aims to provide a cross-platform environment for AI automation, local system access, and multi-LLM integration. This project is inspired by and seeks to extend the ideas of projects like Block Goose, with a focus on openness, extensibility, and privacy.

## Vision
AgentOS is designed to be the next-generation computing platform, enabling AI agents to automate both web and local tasks, and eventually evolve into a true AI-native kernel.

## Phases
- **Phase 1:** Cross-platform agent application (Electron/Tauri, React + Vite, Node.js/Rust backend)
- **Phase 2:** Agent runtime and system integration (background service, desktop automation, plugin architecture)
- **Phase 3:** Agent kernel (AI-driven OS, semantic filesystem, natural language system calls)

## Core Features (Phase 1)
- Web automation engine (browser control via extension + local server)
- Local system bridge (filesystem, shell execution, system monitoring)
- Multi-LLM backend (Qwen, Claude, GPT, Ollama, etc.)
- Agent UI (sidebar, natural language input, task history, permissions)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Electron (Node.js) or Tauri (Rust)
- **Automation:** Browser MCP extension, custom shell executors
- **AI:** Qwen API / Ollama / LM Studio

## Security & Ethics
- Permission prompts, sandboxing, audit log, incognito mode, open source transparency
